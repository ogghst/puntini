# Puntini

Puntini is an AI agent that assists in the creation and management of business improvement projects using Agile and PMI methodologies. It translates natural language prompts and dialogues into entities and relationships on a property graph, complete with validation and audit controls.

The primary objectives are:
- Granular control of the workflow using LangGraph.
- Structured outputs via Pydantic models.
- Idempotent persistence through an abstract GraphStore.
- A FastAPI and React-based user interface.
- End-to-end traceability.

For a detailed breakdown of the architecture, data model, and project plan, please see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
