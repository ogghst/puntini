# F1-1 Implementation: Extract→Validate→Upsert→Answer Flow

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of F1-1, which provides the core Extract→Validate→Upsert→Answer workflow for Project, Epic, Issue, and User entities in the Agile/PMI project management system.

## Architecture

The implementation follows the LangGraph state machine pattern with the following components:

```
User Input → Planning → Tool Selection → Extraction → Validation → Execution → Evaluation → Answer Generation
```

### Core Components

1. **LLM Service** (`services/llm_service.py`)

   - Structured output generation with Pydantic validation
   - Support for multiple providers (DeepSeek, Ollama)
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms

2. **Neo4j GraphStore** (`graphstore/neo4j_store.py`)

   - Patch→Cypher mapping for idempotent operations
   - Constraint validation and health checks
   - Transaction support with rollback on failure

3. **Extraction Tools** (`tools/extraction_tools.py`)

   - ProjectExtractionTool: Extracts project entities
   - UserExtractionTool: Extracts user entities
   - EpicExtractionTool: Extracts epic entities with project relationships
   - IssueExtractionTool: Extracts issue entities with epic relationships

4. **Validation Pipeline** (`validation/validation_pipeline.py`)

   - Multi-stage validation: Schema → Domain → Graph constraints
   - Comprehensive error reporting
   - Progressive validation with early failure detection

5. **LangGraph Workflow** (`agent/graph.py`)
   - Stateful agent with persistent state management
   - Async node implementations
   - Intelligent retry and escalation logic

## Workflow Details

### 1. Planning Node

- Analyzes user goal using LLM
- Generates structured execution plan
- Determines required tools and steps

### 2. Tool Selection Node

- Selects appropriate tools based on current step
- Advances workflow state
- Handles retry scenarios

### 3. Extraction Node

- Executes extraction tools in parallel
- Generates Patch objects for graph operations
- Collects tool outputs and metrics

### 4. Validation Node

- Runs multi-stage validation pipeline
- Validates schema, domain rules, and graph constraints
- Provides detailed error reporting

### 5. Execution Node

- Applies validated patches to graph store
- Handles transaction rollback on failure
- Records operation results

### 6. Evaluation Node

- Determines next steps based on results
- Handles retry logic and escalation
- Manages workflow completion

### 7. Answer Generation Node

- Generates comprehensive user response
- Summarizes operations performed
- Provides next steps and recommendations

## Data Models

### Domain Entities

- **Project**: Project with name, description, and metadata
- **User**: User with ID, name, and metadata
- **Epic**: Epic with title, project relationship, and metadata
- **Issue**: Issue with title, status, epic relationship, and metadata

### Graph Operations

- **Patch**: Atomic operation (AddNode, UpdateProps, AddEdge, Delete)
- **NodeSpec**: Node specification with label, key, and properties
- **EdgeSpec**: Edge specification with source, target, and relationship type

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
2. **Escalation**: Intelligent escalation after max retries
3. **Validation**: Multi-stage validation with detailed error messages
4. **Transaction Safety**: Rollback on any operation failure
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback responses when LLM fails

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Individual component testing
- Mock-based testing for external dependencies
- Comprehensive coverage of error scenarios

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end workflow testing
- Real component integration
- Performance and reliability testing

### Demo Script

- Interactive demonstration of the complete flow
- Example scenarios for all entity types
- Error handling demonstrations

## Usage Example

```python
from agent.graph import StatefulProjectAgent
from tools.tool_registry import ToolRegistry
from context.context_manager import AdaptiveContextManager
from graphstore.neo4j_store import Neo4jStore

# Initialize components
tool_registry = ToolRegistry()
context_manager = AdaptiveContextManager()
graph_store = Neo4jStore(uri="bolt://localhost:7687", username="neo4j", password="password")

# Create agent
agent = StatefulProjectAgent(
    tool_registry=tool_registry,
    context_manager=context_manager,
    graph_store=graph_store,
    observability_service=observability_service
)

# Process user request
result = await agent.process_request(
    user_goal="Create a new project called 'Customer Portal' with a user authentication epic",
    thread_id="user-session-123"
)

print(result["response"])
```

## Configuration

The implementation uses the existing configuration system:

- **LLM Provider**: Configurable via `config.json`
- **Database**: Neo4j connection settings
- **Logging**: Structured logging with configurable levels
- **Validation**: Configurable validation rules and constraints

## Performance Considerations

- **Async Operations**: All nodes are async for better concurrency
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple patches applied in single transaction
- **Caching**: Tool registry with health checks and caching
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and connection management

## Security

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries in Cypher
- **Access Control**: Tool-level access control
- **Audit Trail**: Complete operation logging

## Monitoring

- **Health Checks**: Database and service health monitoring
- **Metrics**: Operation success rates and performance metrics
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for debugging

## Future Enhancements

1. **NebulaGraph Support**: Additional graph database adapter
2. **Advanced Validation**: Business rule engine integration
3. **Caching Layer**: Redis-based caching for performance
4. **API Integration**: REST API for external integrations
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for live updates

## Dependencies

- **LangGraph**: Workflow orchestration
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **Neo4j**: Graph database
- **LangChain**: LLM integration
- **FastAPI**: Web framework (for future API integration)

## Conclusion

The F1-1 implementation provides a robust, scalable foundation for the Extract→Validate→Upsert→Answer workflow. It demonstrates best practices in:

- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management
- **Testing**: Thorough test coverage
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation and examples
- **Maintainability**: Well-structured, readable code

This implementation serves as the foundation for the remaining F1 tasks and provides a solid base for the complete project management system.
